  "faq-q2": "What is the difference between the Detailing and Premium Package?",

The Premium Package is a more standard service, ideal for regular maintenance with interior/exterior washing and careful finishes.",
  
  "faq-q3": "How long does a complete cleaning service take?",
  "faq-a3": "A Premium Package takes about 3 hours. The Detailing Package requires about 6 hours depending on the vehicle's condition and size. We take the necessary time to guarantee an impeccable result without rushing.",
  
  "faq-q4": "Is the Comfort Plus Delivery service included in the price?",

  "faq-q5": "Do I need to book in advance?",
  "faq-a5": "Yes, we work by appointment only to guarantee quality service and respected deadlines. We recommend booking one week in advance preferably, especially during high-demand periods (school holidays, winter season in Megève/Chamonix).",
  
  "faq-q6": "Do you use eco-friendly products?",
  "faq-a6": "We use high-end professional products that respect the environment and your vehicle. Our shampoos and detergents are biodegradable and our techniques limit water consumption thanks to the use of low-consumption Karcher (50L of water per vehicle versus more than 150L for roller washing).",
  
  "faq-q7": "Can I combine several à la carte services?",
  "faq-a7": "Absolutely! Our à la carte services are designed to be combined according to your needs. Contact us to create a personalized quote: we can for example combine a detailing exterior wash + foggy headlight restoration + leather seat shampooing.",
  
  "faq-q8": "Do you work on all types of vehicles?",
  "faq-a8": "Yes, we work on all types of vehicles: sedans, SUVs, sports cars, commercial vehicles, motorcycles, trucks. Our rates are adapted according to the size and type of vehicle. The prices indicated are for standard sedans/SUVs, a personalized quote will be established for specific vehicles.",
  
  "faq-q9": "What if my vehicle is very dirty or neglected?",
  "faq-a9": "No problem! We specialize in the restoration of very dirty vehicles. We recommend the Detailing Package with possibly additional services (pet hair supplement, stubborn stain treatment, polishing per panel, foggy headlight restoration...). Send us photos for an accurate quote."

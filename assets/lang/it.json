  "faq-q2": "What is the difference between the Detailing and Premium Formula?",
  "faq-a2": "The Detailing Formula is our most comprehensive service: it includes bodywork chemical decontamination, engine compartment cleaning, protective wax application and complete leather treatment. The Premium Formula is a more standard service, ideal for regular maintenance with interior/exterior washing and careful finishing.",
  "faq-q3": "How long does a complete cleaning take?",
  "faq-a3": "A Premium Formula takes about 3 hours. The Detailing Formula requires about 6 hours depending on the vehicle's condition and size. We take the necessary time to guarantee an impeccable result without rushing.",

  "faq-q6": "Do you use eco-friendly products?",
  "faq-a6": "We use high-end professional products, environmentally friendly and safe for your vehicle. Our shampoos and detergents are biodegradable and our techniques limit water consumption thanks to the use of low-consumption Karcher (50L of water per vehicle versus over 150L for roller washing).",
  "faq-q7": "Can I combine several à la carte services?",
  "faq-a7": "Absolutely! Our à la carte services are designed to be combined according to your needs. Contact us to create a personalized quote: we can for example combine exterior detailing wash + headlight restoration + leather seat shampooing.",
  "faq-q8": "Do you work on all types of vehicles?",
  "faq-a8": "Yes, we work on all types of vehicles: sedans, SUVs, sports cars, vans, motorcycles, trucks. Our rates are adapted according to size and vehicle type. The prices indicated are for standard sedans/SUVs, a personalized quote will be established for specific vehicles.",
  "faq-q9": "What if my vehicle is very dirty or neglected?",
  "faq-a9": "No problem! We specialize in renovating very dirty vehicles. We recommend the Detailing Formula with possibly additional services (pet hair add-on, stubborn stain treatment, 40% polishing per panel, headlight restoration...). Send us photos for an accurate quote.",

  "polishing-testimonial-2-name": "Anne Dubois",
  "polishing-testimonial-2": "My Audi had many micro-scratches from automatic washes. The 40% polishing was enough to restore a new appearance. I recommend this service!",
  "polishing-testimonial-3-name": "Thomas Richard",
  "polishing-testimonial-3": "Excellent value for polishing. Precise advice on the formula adapted to my vehicle. Result up to my expectations, mirror bodywork!",
  "faq-polishing-q1": "What's the difference between 40% and 90% polishing?",
  "faq-polishing-a1": "The percentage indicates the defect correction rate. 40% polishing eliminates superficial micro-scratches and suits recent vehicles. 90% polishing is deep correction treating significant scratches, oxidation and marked defects. It requires more time (2 days vs 1 day) and is mandatory before ceramic protection.",
  "faq-polishing-q2": "Does polishing damage the paint?",
  "faq-polishing-a2": "No, if done correctly by a professional. Polishing removes a thin layer of clear coat (a few microns) to eliminate surface defects. Our machines and techniques guarantee controlled and safe polishing. A vehicle can be polished 4 to 6 times in its life without risk.",
  "faq-polishing-q3": "How long does the polishing result last?",
  "faq-polishing-a3": "The polishing itself is permanent: corrected defects don't come back. However, shine and protection decrease over time without maintenance. This is why we recommend applying wax (6 months) or ceramic (2 to 5 years) after polishing to sustainably protect the result.",
  "faq-polishing-q4": "Is decontamination really mandatory?",
  "faq-polishing-a4": "Yes, absolutely. Decontamination eliminates embedded contaminants (tar, resin, metallic pollution) that don't come off with regular washing. Without this step, polishing risks embedding these particles even deeper and scratching the paint. It's an essential step for optimal and safe results.",
  "faq-polishing-q5": "Can I have a black/dark car polished?",
  "faq-polishing-a5": "Yes! Dark paints (black, navy blue, anthracite gray) reveal defects more but also benefit from spectacular results after polishing. Color depth and mirror shine are particularly impressive on dark shades. We have the expertise to treat all paint types.",
  "faq-polishing-q6": "What maintenance after polishing?",
  "faq-polishing-a6": "After polishing, favor hand washes with pH neutral products and soft microfibers. Avoid automatic brush washes that create micro-scratches. Regularly apply a detailing spray to maintain shine. Ideally, complete with protection (wax or ceramic) to preserve the result.",

  "faq-covering-q1": "How long does wrapping last?",
  "faq-covering-a1": "Quality wrapping (3M, Avery, Hexis) lasts between 5 and 7 years depending on maintenance and usage conditions. Premium films keep their color and shine without discoloration. Regular maintenance (gentle washing, no direct high pressure) extends lifespan.",
  "faq-covering-q2": "Does wrapping damage original paint?",
  "faq-covering-a2": "No, on the contrary! Wrapping protects original paint against scratches, UV and splashes. When removed, paint is found intact. It's even recommended to preserve resale value. Professional installation guarantees residue-free removal.",
  "faq-covering-q3": "Can I go to automatic wash with wrapping?",
  "faq-covering-a3": "Yes, but favor brushless washes (high pressure only). Avoid aggressive rotating brushes that can lift edges. Hand washing remains ideal to preserve lifespan. No direct high-pressure on joints.",
  "faq-tinting-q1": "Are tinted windows legal?",
  "faq-tinting-a1": "Yes, according to French regulations: front windows (driver/passenger) must have at least 70% light transmission. Rear windows and rear windshield can be tinted without restriction. All our films are approved and comply with highway code.",
  "faq-tinting-q2": "Which shade to choose for my windows?",
  "faq-tinting-a2": "For rear: 5-15% for maximum privacy (very dark), 20-35% for visibility/privacy compromise, 50% for light shade. We advise according to your needs: privacy, thermal protection, aesthetics. 15-20% is most popular for SUVs and sedans.",
  "faq-tinting-q3": "How long does tinted window installation take?",
  "faq-tinting-a3": "Count 2 to 3 hours for a sedan (rear windows + windshield), 3 to 4 hours for complete SUV. Film requires 48h drying: avoid lowering windows during this period. After, normal use without restriction.",
